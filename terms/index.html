    <li><strong>Paid Electric Products License</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our Service provides digital products, including but not limited to App Wallpapers and other electronic content, which are made available for purchase under a license agreement (&ldquo;<strong>Licensed Electric Products</strong>&rdquo;). When you purchase any Licensed Electric Products, you are not buying the product itself but rather purchasing a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the product in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p>The license granted herein allows you to use the Licensed Electric Products for your personal, non-commercial use only. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<ol>
    <ol>
        <li>The Licensed Electric Products remain the exclusive property of Tamdaw's developer Kuan-Ting Lin or its licensors. No ownership rights are transferred to you as a result of this license.</li>
        <li>You shall not modify, distribute, perform, publicly display, create derivative works from, repurpose, or use the Licensed Electric Products beyond the scope of the license granted herein.</li>
        <li>The sale, resale, redistribution, or any form of commercial exploitation of the Licensed Electric Products is strictly prohibited.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<p>In the event of discontinuation of the Service, or if any Licensed Electric Product becomes unavailable or is deleted for any reason, you acknowledge that:</p>
<ol>
    <ol>
        <li>Tamdaw's developer Kuan-Ting Lin shall bear no liability to you or any third party for any claim related to the unavailability or removal of the Licensed Electric Products.</li>
        <li>No refunds, compensation, or reimbursements will be provided for the unavailability, discontinuation, or removal of Licensed Electric Products, except as may be required by applicable law.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
            <ol start="4">
                <li><strong>Subscriptions</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (&ldquo;<strong>Subscription(s)</strong>&rdquo;). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (&ldquo;<strong>Billing Cycle</strong>&rdquo;). Billing cycles are set
                either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Tamdaw&apos;s developer Kuan-Ting Lin cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
                your online account management page or by contacting Tamdaw&apos;s developer Kuan-Ting Lin.</p>
            <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Tamdaw&apos;s developer Kuan-Ting Lin with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address,
                state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Tamdaw&apos;s developer Kuan-Ting Lin to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your
                account to any such payment instruments.</p>
            <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Tamdaw&apos;s developer Kuan-Ting Lin will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to
                the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
            <ol start="5">
                <li><strong>Fee Changes</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Tamdaw&apos;s developer Kuan-Ting Lin, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
            <p>Tamdaw&apos;s developer Kuan-Ting Lin will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
            <p>Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
            <ol start="6">
                <li><strong>Refunds</strong></li>
            </ol>
